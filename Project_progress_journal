Day1:
Started working on project today, Doing the reseach work and collecting the necessary resources for the same. 
Decided to write smartcontract in RUST language and staring to learn RUST programming today, reason for choosing rust were : it is much memory safe, and better for future perspective.
Insalled docker and rust on my WSL2 having ubuntu OS.
Next step is to learn Rust programming along side writing smart contracts with it. Wish me luck :)
